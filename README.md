# StudyNook
StudyNook is designed to be an "all-in-one" study platform for students. Users can keep track of their assignments using kanban boards, take and organize their class notes, make custom quizzes to test themselves, and keep on top of important dates in their calendar. (This project is in collaboration with another amazing dev!)
